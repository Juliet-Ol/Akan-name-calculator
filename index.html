        <p>Akan is a web application that uses your birthday to calculate the day of the week you were born.
        This application is inspired by Ghana a country in West Africa where they use days of the week to name a newborn. Children are given names depending on which day of the week they were born. They are the different set names for male and female.</p>
        <p>In Ghana the first name frequently corresponds to the day one was born and gender.</p>
